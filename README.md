# TearingModeSurvival
A tearing mode prediction model based on the auton-survival deep survival machine.

For simply trying out the model:
- The models, data and configs are located in the Princeton University clusters such as stellar, in /projects/EKOLEMEN/survival_tm_2/ in folders of their name
- Use tm_model_simple_analysis.ipynb for trying out predictions on any shot in the database

For more advanced use, the repository includes the following features:
1) Creating and formatting the database from the data-fetching repo
2) Training the model
3) Basic model analysis and inference
4) Shap analysis
